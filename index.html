                <br>
                <h2>Let's Give a Little Context...</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In this project I will be walking you through my process of redesigning an antiquated fish auction website into a modern, responsive interface.
                    In it's current state, the Aquabid website has many usability problems. 
                    Through a process of both low and high fidelity protyping, and then translating those prototypes into a webapp, I will develop an end product that is more functional than the origial Aquabid interface, 
                    and usable across all devices: desktop, mobile, and tablet. 
                </p>

                <h2>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>Picking a Web page</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Aquabid.com is one of the most popular websites on the internet for aquarium hobbyists to buy and sell their fish. It is essentially the Ebay of fish. However, I believe it is hindered by its antiquated and difficult to use interface, especially on the "view listings" pages. As someone who is an enthusiastic aquarium hobbyist, I chose this website to bring awareness to how a refresh of the interface could bring about a better experience for both new and experienced users who use Aquabid. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Below is an example screenshot of the aquabid "view listings" interface!</p>
                <br>
                <div class = "imgCenter">

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <br>
                <p>WebAIM WAVE detected numerous accessibility problems with Aquabid.com. The vast majority of these critiques I agreed with, but I do not think it went far enough in its critique as I believe it missed many ways in which the current Aquabid website lacks accessibility. I will begin below by detailing a few key critiques WebAIM WAVE had to offer and whether I agree with those critiques. I will round out by discussing what I think WebAIM WAVE missed. </p>
                <br>

                <h4>What WebAIM Suggested</h4>
                <br>
                <h4>Accessibility Issue 1:</h4>
                <br>
                <div class = "problemContainer">
                    <div class = "problemText">
                        
                        <h5>WebAIM WAVE Suggestion</h5> <p>Missing Form Label: A form control does not have a corresponding label.

                        <br>
                        <h5>My Critique</h5>  <p>I agree with this assessment. Having just an empty field can be confusing for users and provides no guidance to users who are using audible labeling to navigate the website.</p>
